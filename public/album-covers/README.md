# Album Covers

Place your album cover images in this folder. 

## Naming Convention:
- album-1.jpg (or .png, .webp)
- album-2.jpg
- album-3.jpg
- ... and so on

## Image Requirements:
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Square aspect ratio (1:1) recommended
- **Resolution**: 400x400px or higher for best quality
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for best performance

## How it works:
The component will automatically cycle through your images. If you have fewer than 25 images, they will repeat to fill all positions in the grid.

## Fallback:
If an image fails to load, the component will show a colorful gradient with music symbols as a fallback.
